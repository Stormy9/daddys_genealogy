Team Nerdvana -- recent graduates from Western Oregon University's Computer Science program -- are making a web app out of my (Tricia's) Dad's genealogy project.

Dad started working on genealogy in 1956.  He inherited some family records and even some tree drawings by family members who came before him; he has added to that significantly over the years, including drawing an entire "forest" of family trees (different sections of the family get their own tree -- otherwise it would be too large, just physically, to manage!)

Back in the 1990's, I (Tricia) made a very rudimentary database for him using Microsoft Access.  Between then and now, he and his brother Jerry input over 16,000 family members (going back to the 1600's).

He also has considerable data on my Mom's side of the family!

Dad's heritage is 100% Norwegian... he recently had a DNA test done which confirmed that he is 96% Norwegian, with a 4% margin of error (with the other possible ethnicity being Swedish).  Each of Mom's four grandparents have a different point of origin:  Norway, Russia, Germany, and England.

I (Tricia) along with my younger sister have the distinction of being the only people related to every single family tree Dad has made.   [=

I'll come back later and add some further explanatory sections!

Anyway, the reason we would like to bring this project to life as a web app is two-fold:
1) so that other designated family members can assist with the continuation of the family genealogy (Daddy is 83 now, but still going strong!)

and
2) so that any family member can look themselves up and see how they are connected to others 

and
3) so that family members can find their "branch number" -- their "coordinates" so that they are able to find themselves (or any other relative!) on their print of their section of the family tree!
